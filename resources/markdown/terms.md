# Terms of Service

Thank you for using MyWebsite! We're happy you're here. Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before accessing or using MyWebsite. Because it is such an important contract between us and our users, we have tried to make it as clear as possible. For your convenience, we have presented these terms in a short non-binding summary followed by the full legal terms.

Effective date: Agustus 04, 2021

A. Definitions

Short version: We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.


1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with MyWebsite. A “User Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on MyWebsite. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.

1. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the MyWebsite Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at docs.github.com/categories/site-policy.

1. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.

1. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.

1. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to MyWebsite, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.

1. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by MyWebsite, including any Beta Previews.

1. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See Section B(5): Additional Terms).

1. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at github.com, and all content, services, and products provided by MyWebsite at or through the Website. It also refers to MyWebsite-owned subdomains of github.com, such as education.github.com and pages.github.com. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as githubuniverse.com, and product websites, such as atom.io. Occasionally, websites owned by MyWebsite may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.
